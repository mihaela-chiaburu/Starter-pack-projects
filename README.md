## Overview
This project is a collection of basic apps that every IT student usually builds when learning to code. I combined them all into one ASP.NET Core app to make things easier and more organized.
Youâ€™ll find simple and useful tools like a calculator, a weather app, and more. The goal is to practice and improve my coding skills while having fun building something useful.

## Features
- **Calculator**: Basic arithmetic operations.
- **To-Do List**: Manage tasks.
- **Weather App**: Check the forecast with a simple API call.
- **Modular Design**: Separate controllers and services.

## Technologies
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core
- **Development Tools**: Visual Studio 2022
- **API**: https://www.weatherapi.com/ for weather data
- **Deployment**: Docker, Railway
